//Madhav went to Riya's birthday.He was a geek so he had no idea regarding which gift she'ld like.So he took an array of integers with him.The array followed a particular order.First element of array is 1.Second element of array is 6.
Other elements of array are two less than the mean of the number precedin g and succeding it.As it is obvious Riya felt that this idea was stupid and hence she wanted to punish Madhav.She decided to ask Madhav the nth number of the array . If he tells the wrong answer,she would slap him.Help Madhav to escape from this embarassing situation.

Input:
The input starts with T the number of Testcases.
Next T lines contain integer N.

S/I : 2 1 3
S/O : 1 15

Explanation:
First test case is trivial as a [1] = 1.
In second test cases a[2]=(a[1]+a[3])/2-2.
Substituing the values of a[1] and a[2] we get 
6 = (1+a[2])/2-2.So a[2]=8*2-1=15.
